# WWII Museum - Voices from the Front

## Overview and Origin

The National WWII Museum in New Orleans, La.

June 6, 2000 was it's opening day.  It took approximately 10 years from the time of concept for the museum to open.

Stephen E. Ambrose and Gordon H. 'Nick' Mueller are it's founders.

Stephen Ambrose and Gordon Mueller were both PhDs working together at the University of New Orleans.  They were also best friends for many years.  The both shared a common interest in history, particularly the history of WWII.  In 1990 and continuing for the next 10 years, they worked to create a museum to honor the more than 16.1 million men and women who served the United States durning the war.
Of the millions of personel who served, less than 120,000 are still alive today.  The museum decided to create an interactive exhibit that allowed the museum's visitors to talk with life size visual video representations of 18 service members who served during the war.

The museum was funded by private donations.  No government funding was used for the museum's creation or ongoing expenses.  1.5 million dollars in donations were received for this exhibit.

## Business Activities

The museum wanted to create an interactive exhibit where visitors could converse with some of the last WWII survivors.  To be able to ask questions and receive answers, while viewing a likeness of the person answering the question.  The exhibit was made by first interviewing, recording and filming 18 surviving WWII participants.  Up to 10 cameras were used to capture the video of the persons being intervened.  Each person being interviewed was asked up to 1000 questing which were stored as data. When a question is asked, AI is used to find the closest answer to the question.  With the current technology, the answers may take a few seconds to find the best answer.  It is expected that the system will learn how to answers questions more rapidly as it evolves with additional data.

The museum's 'intended audience is all of the population who is interested in US history, particularly WWII history.

There is no other museum for WWII that has an exhibit such as Voices From the Front.

The exhibit is powered by Conversa AI, an AI-powered conservational video platform.  Conversa AI is a no-code platform that provides tools to collect video, create and train AI interactions. Conversa AI is an artificial intelligence, natural language processing and machine learning platform.

## Landscape

The museum's intended audiane is for history education and entertainment.

Conversa AI is a relative new platform and didn't exist 10 years ago. Conversational AI is not a new concept, The first chatbot was created in 1966 and was called ELIZA.  The technology has progressed over the years into what is now available. 10 years ago, conversational AI was primarily used in customer service and support to help customers with their queries. Today, conversational AI is used in various chatbots and virtual assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Seri and Microsoft's Cortana 


The museum's main competitors are:'
National Museum of the Marine Corps., Triangle, VA
National Museum of the Pacific War, Fredericksburg, TX
American Heritage Museum, Stow, MA


## Results

The exhibit is relatively new.  It first opened to the public on October 5, 2023.  The exhibit has been favorably reviewed and is expected to be a main attraction to draw in more visitors.

The main measure of performance can be measured by attendance and customer feedback.

There are no competitors doing what this exhibit does.

## Recommendations

I would advise the museum to interview as many more WWII participants as possible, before it's too late.

More participants would provide more data to the pool and add a broader experience for museum attendees. Better machine learning with occur with more data to learn from.

AI is data based and can make better responses to queries and learn more from as much data as possible.
